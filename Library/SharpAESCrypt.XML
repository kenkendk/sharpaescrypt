            <summary>
            A link connecting a streaming writer to a streaming reader through a buffer.
            Should be used to enable multithreading by linking sequential processes avoiding tempfiles (piping).
            Safe for a single reader and writer to be in different threads. It is possible to pass the written
            data on to an underlying stream. Use another DirectLinkStream as passthrough to feed multiple spawned
            threads processing data.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            For .NET &gt;= 4: Use ManualResetEventSlim and Task-class

            Main lock to synchronize operations between reader and writer.

            on blocking thereon.
